# Web Development Project 2 - Math Off Flashcards

Submitted by: Temidayo Akinyemi

This web app can be described as a math quiz flashcard site. Users can use the items stored in flashcard-like format to study, learn something new, or play a guessing game. Users will be able to study cards in a randomized order.
